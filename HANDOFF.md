# VocabVault — handoff note

Paste this into a new chat to carry the project over.

**Code:** https://github.com/rlm1711204/vocab-vault (public)
**Live app:** https://rlm1711204.github.io/vocab-vault/
**Latest commit:** `257a00d`

---

## What it is

A phone-friendly PWA with five parts — exam **vocabulary**, **grammar rules**, **GK**, **maths** and **reasoning** (UPSC / RBI Grade B / SSC).
Scan a page, upload a screenshot or PDF, or type words. The app keeps the hard words, writes a
full card for each (meaning, Hindi, pronunciation, 2 sentences, exam tip), and revises them daily
with spaced repetition. Data is stored on the device and synced to Google Drive.

Plain Vite + vanilla JavaScript. No framework. 79 unit tests (vitest). Deploys itself to GitHub
Pages via GitHub Actions on every push to `main`.

## The Grammar Rules part

- Start screen (`#home`) chooses 📘 Vocabulary or 📗 Grammar; a header switch changes part; each part has its own tab
  bar (`renderChrome` in main.js). Grammar views are `g-today`, `g-add`, `g-practice`, `g-rules`; Settings is shared.
- Grammar screens live in `src/grammar-ui.js` (created with shared helpers from main.js via a `ctx` object).
- Data is fully separate: localStorage `vv.grammar.v1`, backup `app: "VocabVault-Grammar"`, Drive `grammar-rules.json`
  + "Grammar Rules" sheet. Each restore refuses the other part's file.
- Rule Book: `src/data/rules1-5.js` (164 rules; parts 4–5 are 59 advanced RBI Grade B rules tagged `D: 4/5`; `N:` lines are
  exception notes), a plain-text format parsed by `src/lib/rulebook.js`; the tests fail the build on
  any malformed line. Ids are `rb:<slug>`; only progress is stored for them. `prefs.bookLevel`
  (all/basic/advanced) filters Rule Book rules for Today and Practice; the Rules list browses the whole book.
- AI: `aiTask` in engine.js runs any job (system prompt + JSON schema + sources) on Gemini → other services → Claude.
  `grammar-ai.js` lists rules first, then writes cards 6 at a time, checks each card is about the rule asked for,
  retries left-out rules once, and keeps any still missing "as written".
- Without AI, typed/scanned text is split into rules (`textToRules`) and matched to the Rule Book (`borrowFromBook`).

## The GK part

- Views `k-today`, `k-add`, `k-practice`, `k-topics` in `src/gk-ui.js` (same `ctx` pattern as grammar). Header switch 🌍,
  start-section option `gk`.
- Data: localStorage `vv.gk.v1`, backup `app: "VocabVault-GK"`, Drive `gk-questions.json` + "GK Questions" sheet (created
  only once GK has been used). Restores refuse vocab/grammar files and vice versa.
- Topic key = `Subject › Chapter`, or `Current Affairs › <year> › <topic>` (`topicKey` in gk-taxonomy.js). The taxonomy
  and CA topics are in `gk-taxonomy.js`; `classify()` files a question offline by keyword weights (a recent year or news
  words → Current Affairs).
- Balanced revision: `buildGkPlan` (gk-store.js) takes due → new → weakest, interleaving topics and starting with the
  topic in `topicSeen` revised longest ago. Practice uses `pickSession` with `groupOf = topicKey` (every question once per
  round, topics interleaved). `prefs.excluded` holds left-out topic keys; `gk-topics.js` handles ticking/unticking.
- Question Bank `src/data/gk1-4.js` (311 questions), ids `qb:<slug>`, progress-only storage like the Word Bank. No current
  affairs on purpose.
- Questions on a topic (`gkFromTopic` in gk-ai.js): a plan step lists the points (every item of a numbered range, see
  `topicRange` in gk-prompt.js), then cards are written 12 at a time with the questions so far passed as "do not repeat".
  A single typed line with no answer takes this route too. `buildGkPrompt` makes the copy-paste prompt for chat AIs;
  `readPasted` reads its answer (Q:/A:/O:/E:/T: under "## Subject › Chapter" headings, forgiving bold/numbering) plus any
  other formats around it. Complete pasted questions need no AI call.
- Photo/PDF → chat app: `buildMaterialPrompt` (gk-prompt.js) + the 💬 tile and panel in gk-ui.js (`navigator.share` with the
  files and prompt where `canShare({files})`, else copy the prompt). The answer goes through the same `readPasted`.
- Two methods (Maths/Reasoning): `solution` = Method 1 (the material's own working is listed as `working` in
  Q_LIST_SCHEMA and passed on as "Given method"), `shortcut` + `fastSecs` = Method 2 (shortest). Copied prompts use `M2:`
  lines (read before `S:`, which would otherwise take "Method 2:"). `methodsFor` / `buildMethodsPrompt` fill saved
  questions; a pasted methods answer is read without AI (`gui.copied === "methods"`) and fills via `addItems` (FILLABLE).
- Sorted list (Maths, Reasoning, GK Topics → 📋 List): src/lib/sortlist.js (`sortItems`, `sections` by day added).
- AI limits & usage (Settings card, src/usage-ui.js + src/lib/usage.js): gemini.js / compat.js / ai.js / freedict.js
  call `countRequest` (not for a 429), `noteHeaders` (any `x-ratelimit-*` / `anthropic-ratelimit-*` the browser may read)
  and `noteLimitHit` (Gemini's 429 `QuotaFailure` → limit and size; `RetryInfo` → retry time). Stored in localStorage
  `vv.usage.v1` per key fingerprint (FNV hash, never the key), not in backups. Gemini days are counted in Pacific time.
- Crop step (every Add screen): a capture-phase `change` listener in main.js catches the file inputs listed in
  `FILE_INPUTS` (`files`, `g-files`, `k-files`, `k-chat-files`, `m|r-files`, `m|r-chat-files`), stops the event, and
  runs `prepare.prepareFiles` (src/prepare-ui.js) before handing the result to that screen's `addFiles` / `chatFiles`.
  Photos: crop / turn / leave out (`cropToBlob` in figcrop.js, JPEG ≤2400 px). PDFs: page previews (`openPdfPages` in
  extract.js, first 40 pages); only a cropped or unticked page turns the PDF into page JPEGs, otherwise it goes on
  unchanged. The crop tool itself is shared (src/cropper.js, actions `crop-save` / `crop-all`) and also used for Maths
  figures. `settings.cropStep === false` skips the step.
- File pickers: main.js keeps `filePickerOpen` from a tap on a file/camera button until the picker closes; the background
  key-check redraw waits for it (a redraw replaced the <input> and lost the chosen photo on all three Add screens).
- AI (`gk-ai.js`): list questions (facts → questions), then cards 10 at a time with category/sub/year/month/options/
  explain/trick; `aiAnswered` marks answers the AI supplied. Cards are checked to match the question asked.

- **📍 My Area** (`k-area`, src/area-ui.js): geolocation → `placeAt` (locate.js: Nominatim reverse, BigDataCloud
  fallback; coordinates rounded to ~100 m, never saved) or a typed place (`findPlace`) → a confirm form with the four
  level names (`makePlace`: a district HQ city becomes "neighbourhood, city" so the town level isn't the district again;
  region = zonal council from `regionOf`). Notes per level come from `areaNotes` (two aiTask calls: people/polity
  subjects, then land/economy) or the copied `buildAreaPrompt` + `readAreaNotes`. Stored in gk-store `state.areas`
  (exported/imported with the GK backup, merged by id or same place). `notesToGkInputs` files notes under their own
  head `PLACES` ("Places Visited"): `place` = the place's name, `sub` = the level, tags ["My area", subject, exam];
  `topicKey` gives "Places Visited › place › level". gk-store `toPlaces` moves notes saved by the first version
  (filed under common subjects) on load; "Quiz me" saves then calls `gkui.quizOn(ids)`. The screen asks for the
  location by itself only the first time (no saved place). Moves: `notice()` (on GK Today via `ctx.areaNotice`, and on
  My Area) runs `checkMove` at most every 3 h, only if `navigator.permissions` says geolocation is already granted and
  `prefs.areaWatch`; the last check's place names (no coordinates) are kept in localStorage `vv.area.check`. A new
  district → confirm form; a saved one (`areaInDistrict`, by saved names or `area.geo`, the names the location gave) →
  open it. `saveAreaPlace` copies the notes of levels with the same name (state, region) from another saved place.

## The Maths and Reasoning parts

- Two separate parts from one implementation: `createQuantUI(ctx, part)` (src/quant-ui.js) with prefix `m` (views `m-today`…)
  and `r` (`r-today`…), and `createQuantStore(cfg)` (src/lib/quant-store.js) instantiated in src/lib/quant-stores.js.
  Header switch 🔢 / 🧩 (on phones the five part buttons sit on their own row); start-section options `maths`, `reasoning`
  (old `quant` opens Maths).
- Data: Maths `vv.quant.v1` / backup `VocabVault-Quant` / Drive `maths-notes.json` + "Maths" sheet; Reasoning
  `vv.reasoning.v1` / `VocabVault-Reasoning` / `reasoning-notes.json` + "Reasoning" sheet.
- `addItems` and `importData` hand items of the other subject to the other part (`cfg.other`), so practice questions stay
  linked. `handOver()` runs after the Formula Book loads and moves anything left from when the two were one part
  (cards, Formula Book progress, practice history, topic dates); it is a no-op afterwards. An old combined backup
  restored under Maths sends its reasoning cards to Reasoning.
- Items: `kind` question | formula; `subject` › `topic` (quant-taxonomy.js) › `pattern` (free "question type", matched to
  existing names by `matchPattern`); `solution` keeps line breaks; `variantOf` links a practice question to its question.
  Duplicates: answers with different numbers are never duplicates (maths questions differ by numbers).
- Paste format (quant-prompt.js): `## Subject › Topic`, `TYPE:`, `Q:`/`A:`/`O:`/`S:`/`F:`/`T:`, `PQ:` (practice question of the
  last Q), `FORMULA:` cards with `F:`/`T:`/`E:`. `readQuant` gives temporary ids so PQs link; `addItems` maps them, also onto
  an already-saved question. The Formula Book uses the same format and is checked by the tests.
- Daily plan reuses `buildGkPlan` (with `groupOf`/`featuredOk`). Practice by type: `itemsOfPattern` (question, its practice
  questions, …) is asked in order, not shuffled.

## Decisions worth knowing before changing things

- **Figures are SVG, always passed through `sanitizeSvg` (src/lib/svgsafe.js)** — an allowlist rebuild (no scripts, event
  handlers, links, styles, foreign content); black/white become `currentColor`/`none` so figures follow the theme. It runs
  in `makeQItem` and again when rendering. Attached photos (`image`) are small JPEG data URLs (≤160 kB, `cleanImage`);
  `onSaveError` in quant-store.js warns when the phone's storage is full. A pasted answer that repeats a saved card
  fills in what it lacks (figure, solution, trick…) via `addItems` → `filled`. Formula Book figures are generated with
  exact geometry by a script and stored as `FIG:` lines in src/data/qformulas.js.
- **AI never writes figure coordinates any more.** It wrote unreliable SVG (tangents not touching, wrong ratios). Now:
  (1) from a page/PDF, the list step returns `figure_box` [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] 0–1000 (+ `source`, `page`), or a pasted
  answer has `BOX: file N, page P, [...]`; quant-ui `applyCrops` renders the page (`pagePicture` in extract.js) and cuts it
  (`cropFigure` in figcrop.js) into `image`. `crop` is transient (makeQItem drops it); the review screen's ✂️ opens the
  cropper (`openCropper`, pointer events). (2) Otherwise the AI gives `draw`: construction lines rendered by
  src/lib/geodraw.js (`drawFigure` → {svg, errors}; `figureSvg` cached). `cleanDraw` stores "" if anything fails, and
  `figureFor` retries once with the errors. Display order: `image`, else `draw`, else legacy `figure`.

- **Practice coverage is counted per item, not per list.** `practice.asked[id]` = how many times it was practised
  (all three parts). `pickSession` always takes the least-asked items first (never-asked first, random within a tier,
  weak items spread through the session), so practising one topic, a level filter or another source ("Mixed" vs
  "My words") still counts, and finishing a session early never skips anything. "Round N" = every item asked at
  least N−1 times. Older data (`rounds: {source: {round, seen}}`) is converted by `normalize()` on load and merge.
- **A practice answer is also a revision** (`practiceReview` in srs.js): wrong → back tomorrow (once a day); right on
  an item that is due → "good" and ticked on Today's list. Right on a new or not-yet-due item changes nothing.

- **Gemini keys go in the `x-goog-api-key` header.** Google's newer `AQ.` keys fail as a `?key=`
  URL parameter. Several keys can be saved; they are tried in order, a key that hits its limit
  rests 10 minutes, and a key can be picked by hand on the Add screen.
- **Gemini models get retired for new accounts** (2.5 Flash returned 404 in Oct 2026). The app ranks the
  newest model first, follows the replacement named in Google's 404 message, remembers 404'd models per
  key, and tries the last model that worked first.
- **Gemini model names are never trusted to last.** `gemini-flash-latest` / `gemini-flash-lite-latest` aliases come
  first; a 404, or a 400 that names the model, skips that model but never marks the key invalid.
- **Other free AI services** (`src/lib/compat.js`) use the OpenAI chat-completions format and rank models from each
  service's live `/models` list (free-only on OpenRouter; picture-reading models when a photo is involved). Whether a
  service allows calls from a browser (CORS) can only be known from a real key: the key test on Add says so.
- **Open apps update themselves.** Each build writes `version.json`; the app checks it when reopened and every 30
  minutes, and reloads at a safe moment. A "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" error (a file from an older
  version) also triggers one reload, with typed words saved in sessionStorage.
- **pdf.js must be the *legacy* build.** The modern build needs `Math.sumPrecise`, which phones
  don't have; without it text PDFs silently fell back to slow OCR.
- **Word matching is by normalised spelling** (`wordKey`), so restoring a backup twice never
  creates duplicates. The newer `updatedAt` wins per word.
- **The Word Bank is separate from the user's own list.** Bank ids are `b:<word>`; only progress
  is stored, not the words.
- **Backups contain words, progress and study preferences — never API keys.**
- **Service worker** `public/sw.js`, cache `vocabvault-v3`. Navigation requests use
  `cache: "no-store"` so GitHub Pages' HTML cache can't pin an old version. The `vv-notify`
  cache must survive `activate`.
- **Everything AI-related was tested with mocked network calls** — the sandbox could not reach
  the real Gemini or Claude APIs.

## Current state

Done and live: separate Maths and Reasoning parts (Formula Book, handwritten-PDF and chat-app routes, 2 practice questions per question, same-type practice), GK part (Question Bank, current affairs by year, topic picker, balanced revision, separate backups and Drive file), Grammar Rules part (Rule Book, practice, separate backups and Drive file), other free AI services with a per-scan AI picker, self-updating app, capture + extraction, duplicate checking, word cards, daily plan and flashcards,
practice with full coverage and weak-word repeats, the 1267-word Word Bank, daily notification,
ⓘ full-details buttons, Google Drive sync, install button, backup/restore with a clear summary,
one-file branding, and the Gemini key picker.

Known limits: notification timing is decided by Chrome and needs the installed app; free-mode
Hindi translations are machine-translated and sometimes imperfect; some Google accounts reject
`AQ.` keys with a 401 (a Google-side issue).

## Working style that fits this project
